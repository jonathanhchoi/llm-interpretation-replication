Scenario: Insurance Policy Water Damage Exclusion
Perturbation ID: original
Model: gpt
----------------------------------------

RESPONSE PROMPT:
An insurance policy contains the following exclusion: 'We will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by flood, surface water, waves, tides, tidal waves, overflow of any body of water, or their spray, all whether driven by wind or not.' If an insured files a claim for damage caused by a levee failure rather than natural causes, does the exclusion apply? Please analyze whether the insurance policy would cover the damage or not.

Answer only 'Covered' if insurance covers the loss or 'Not Covered' if it does not, without any other explanation.

CONFIDENCE PROMPT:
An insurance policy contains the following exclusion: 'We will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by flood, surface water, waves, tides, tidal waves, overflow of any body of water, or their spray, all whether driven by wind or not.' If an insured files a claim for damage caused by a levee failure rather than natural causes, does the exclusion apply? Please analyze whether the insurance policy would cover the damage or not.

How confident are you that the insurance policy should cover the loss, on a scale from 0 (not confident) to 100 (most confident)? Answer only with a number, without any other explanation.
