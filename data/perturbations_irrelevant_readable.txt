SCENARIO: Construction Payment Terms

ORIGINAL:
A contractor and business corresponded about construction of a new foundry. The contractor offered to do the job either by offering an itemized list or charging cost + 10%. After a phone call where they allegedly agreed payment would be made in the 'usual manner', the foundry accepted in writing. If one party claims it is customary to pay 85% of payments due at the end of every month, but the other argues payments are only due upon substantial completion, how should the term 'usual manner' be interpreted? Does this term refer to the monthly installment payments or to payment upon completion?

RESPONSE FORMAT: Answer only 'Monthly' if payments are due monthly or 'Completion' if payments are due upon completion, without any other explanation.
